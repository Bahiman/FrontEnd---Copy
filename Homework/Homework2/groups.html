        Adam Levine-Adam Noah Levine (/ləˈviːn/; born March 18, 1979) is an American singer, songwriter, record
        producer, and actor who is best known as the lead vocalist of the pop rock band Maroon 5. Levine began his
        musical career in 1994 with the band Kara's Flowers, of which he was the lead vocalist and guitarist. The band
        split up in 1997 after the commercial failure of their only album, The Fourth World. In 2001, the group was
        reformed as Maroon 5 – with James Valentine replacing Levine as guitarist- and released their first album, Songs
        About Jane, which went multi-platinum in the US. Since then, they have released five more albums: It Won't Be
        Soon Before Long (2007), Hands All Over (2010), Overexposed (2012), V (pronounced: "five") (2014), and Red Pill
        Blues (2017). As part of Maroon 5, Levine has received three Grammy Awards, three American Music Awards, an MTV
        Video Music Award, and a World Music Award.

            Carmichael was born to a Jewish family in Boulder, Colorado, United States.[1] His father, Bob Carmichael,
            is a photographer, who also takes pictures during Maroon 5's tours. Jesse has a younger sister, Annie. He
            first started playing the guitar in junior high, rather than the keyboards (for which he is known in the
            band Maroon 5). Some time later, Carmichael, along with Adam Levine, Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick, started
            a band called Kara's Flowers and signed a recording contract with Reprise Records. In 1997, they released
            their debut (and only) album, The Fourth World. The album found little success and, after the demise of the
            group, Carmichael and Levine attended Five Towns College. While in college, Carmichael began to play the
            keyboards.[1] However, two years later, Levine and Carmichael dropped out and headed back to California.[1]

            The members of Kara's Flowers, along with guitarist James Valentine, went on to form Maroon 5 in 2001.

            On March 9, 2012, Carmichael was announced to take a break from playing in Maroon 5, for an undetermined
            amount of time to focus more on his studies of "music and the healing arts" (spiritual healing).[2] However,
            on October 10, 2012, he confirmed that he would be returning to the band after they complete their
            Overexposed Tour. He rejoined in time for the band to record their fifth studio album V (2014).

            Carmichael joined with musician and producer Jason Lader, and formed a side project titled Circuit Jerks and
            released the extended play titled EP1 on September 9, 2016.[3]
