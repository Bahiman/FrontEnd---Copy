    Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials MJ,[9] is an American businessman and
    former professional basketball player. He is the principal owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets of the
    National Basketball Association (NBA) and of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. He played 15 seasons in the NBA,
    winning six championships with the Chicago Bulls. His biography on the official NBA website states: "By acclamation,
    Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time."[5] He was integral in helping to popularize the NBA
    around the world in the 1980s and 1990s,[10] becoming a global cultural icon in the process.[11]

    Jordan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a
    freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as
    the third overall draft pick, and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring
    while gaining a reputation as one of the game's best defensive players.[12] His leaping ability, demonstrated by
    performing slam dunks from the free throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames "Air Jordan" and "His
    Airness". Jordan won his first NBA championship with the Bulls in 1991, and followed that achievement with titles in
    1992 and 1993, securing a "three-peat". Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to
    play Minor League Baseball, but returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in
    1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular-season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season. He retired for a
    second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington
    Wizards.

    Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, ten
    scoring titles (both all-time records), five MVP Awards, ten All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive
    First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game selections, three All-Star Game MVP Awards, three steals titles, and
    the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average
    (30.12 points per game) and career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the 20th
    century's greatest North American athlete by ESPN, and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press' list of
    athletes of the century. Jordan was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009
    for his individual career and again in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team ("The
    Dream Team"). He became a member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015.

<div class="text">Manuel Peter Neuer (German pronunciation: [ˈmaːnu̯eːl ˈnɔʏ.ɐ, -ɛl -]; born 27 March 1986) is a German
    professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper and captains both Bundesliga club Bayern Munich and the Germany
    national team. He is regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers in the history of the sport.[nb 1] Neuer has been
    described as a "sweeper-keeper" because of his playing style and speed when rushing off his line to anticipate
    opponents, going out of the goalkeeper box.[5][6][30] He was named the best goalkeeper of the decade from 2011 to
    2020 by IFFHS.[31]

    Neuer started his career at Schalke 04 where he won the DFB-Pokal and DFL-Ligapokal. In 2011, he signed for Bayern
    Munich and has since won 24 trophies, including eight Bundesliga titles and two UEFA Champions League titles. In
    2014, Neuer finished third in the voting, behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award.
    He was awarded the UEFA Goalkeeper of the Year and the IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper five times each.
