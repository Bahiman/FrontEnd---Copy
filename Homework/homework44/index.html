        Hello, let's not push around the bush and start. So first thing that I want to tell you that I had an abunbace
        of free time. "What is the doom the doom then?", you may ask. But the thing is that I have got a sacrum injury.
        It meant that I will not be able to: jump, run, bend,and etc. So most of the time I have spent was playing video
        games, watching movies, sometimes reading. I also had exercise breaks, but they were inconsistent and did not take that long
