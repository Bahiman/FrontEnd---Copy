The diagram above depicts the 3 crucial processes by which all of the rainwater in an Australian town is undergone and is further 
transported to houses all over the area. These processes account for: filtration, storage and further processing of the collected precipation. 

Spread of rainwater begins with collecting the precipitation using drains which are an architectural part of every house. The collected rainwater is then filtered by a filter and after that falls 
straight to the storage tank. From there, water is carried away directly to water treatment section. There, chemicals, which make the water safe to drink, are ejected. 

After that, clean, safe to drink water is distributed among residents for further houshold use such as showering, drinking and laundary. In order to keep the water clean, it is distributed by piping 
which is different from the one that carries dirty rainwater
